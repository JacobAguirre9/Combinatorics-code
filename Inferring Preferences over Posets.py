# Inferring preferences over a linear ordering of posets can be a complex task that depends on the specific problem and the data you have. 
# One common way to infer preferences is to use a machine learning algorithm such as a comparison-based algorithm. 
# These algorithms are designed to learn a linear ordering of posets by comparing pairs of posets and determining which one is preferred.

# Here's an example of how you might write a Python function that uses a comparison-based algorithm to infer preferences over a linear ordering of posets:

import random
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def infer_preferences(posets, features, labels):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    score = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("Model accuracy: ", score)

    while True:
        poset1 = random.choice(posets)
        poset2 = random.choice(posets)
        while poset1 == poset2:
            poset2 = random.choice(posets)
        feature1 = extract_features(poset1)
        feature2 = extract_features(poset2)
        comparison = model.predict([feature1, feature2])
        if comparison[0] == 1:
            print(f"Poset {poset1} is preferred over Poset {poset2}")
        else:
            print(f"Poset {poset2} is preferred over Poset {poset1}")

# I am almost certain this would work >_<
